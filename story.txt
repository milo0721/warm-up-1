Today tom woke up and it was raining outside. 
Tom left his umbrealla at Susan's cardboard box house.
good thing he has a rubber glove to keep his hand dry.
It's raining cats and dog., Tom excluding his left hand, is soaking wet.
Tom knocks on the door of susan's luxary cordboard box. She answers and greets him with a kiss on the eye ball.
Using his wit and charm, his only goal is to get his umbrella back... by any means necessary.
She hands him the umbrella and tells her she smells like a pair of dirty underware. She smiles and blushes at the compliment. Tom heads out to his job as a male dancer for cats.
